# SharpestMinds
Contains skill tests and projects completed for SharpestMinds apprenticeship

SharpestMind's is an online, machine learning apprenticeship connecting "elite graduate and undergraduate STEM students with companies for virtual and in-person work terms."
This program provides curriculums and skill-tests that allow students to learn and improve on ML and software engineering topics before applying to these jobs.

1. PythonTest  
    Contains my first ML project, as well as first work done in Python!
    Was intended to get first exposure to scikit-learn and basic ML methods

2. XGBoostTest  
    My second ML/ Python project.
    This was done during my first freelance project through SharpestMinds, as we believed XGB would be required to complete it.
    
3. Freelance  
    Intentionally left out the company name.
    Project goal was to estimate features using location data, and to use these predictions to further predict more features in an incomplete dataset.
    Much of the actual ML algorithm usage was done through cloud servers in a Jupyter notebook, which I no longer have access to. I included the code that was done locally, so mostly just writing preprocessing functions.
